                <h2 class="subtitle">General Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to KEVin, the Vulnerability API provided by GTFKD. By using our service, you agree to the following terms and conditions. These terms are subject to change, and updates will be announced via our <a href="https://x.com/synfinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Follow us on X.com">X.com account, synfinner</a>. 
                    You are responsible for reviewing these terms regularly to stay informed about any changes. Your continued use of KEVin constitutes your acceptance of any modifications.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Service Availability</h2>
                <p>
                    We strive to maintain optimal uptime for KEVin, ensuring a reliable experience for all users. However, we do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, and we are not responsible for any downtime or service interruptions that may occur due to technical failures, maintenance, or other unforeseen circumstances. KEVin is provided "as is" without warranties or guarantees of any kind, either expressed or implied. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may schedule regular maintenance periods and will attempt to notify users in advance. However, emergency maintenance or unforeseen technical issues may lead to unscheduled downtimes.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Free Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    KEVin is free of charge for standard usage, which includes a set limit of API calls. Users are encouraged to explore the features within these usage boundaries to maximize the value of the service. We reserve the right to modify these usage limits at any time, with prior notification provided through our <a href="https://x.com/synfinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Follow us on X.com">X.com account</a> or email alerts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For heavy users or organizations requiring higher usage limits, a verification process is required. Please contact us to discuss your needs and requirements.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Abuse and Usage Limits</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure fair usage for all users and the overall health of the platform, KEVin enforces specific usage limits. Requests exceeding two requests per second are considered abusive and may result in throttling or temporary suspension of access. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you require higher usage limits or expect high traffic, please reach out to us directly. Upon verification of ownership and purpose, we may consider allowing additional limits through IP allowlisting. Keep in mind that any abuse, such as attempting to bypass usage limits, may result in permanent termination of access to KEVin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to monitor usage patterns and take corrective action when necessary to maintain the quality and integrity of the service.
                </p>
