                <p>
                    GTFKD is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users. As part of our privacy commitment, we do not collect, store, link, aggregate, or sell any personal data. Our services are specifically designed to operate without the need for any personally identifiable information (PII). This means that you can use our services completely anonymously, and we will never ask for, store, or process any personal details such as names, addresses, email addresses, or payment information.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Cloudflare as Gateway</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to enhance the security, performance, and reliability of our services, GTFKD utilizes Cloudflare as its gateway provider. Cloudflare, as part of its operational role, may collect certain types of data including, but not limited to, IP addresses, User-Agent strings, browsing behaviors, and device information. This data is used solely for the purposes of maintaining the security of our service and optimizing performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that Cloudflare’s data collection and practices are separate from those of GTFKD and are governed by their own privacy policies. GTFKD does not control or have access to the data collected by Cloudflare. We strongly encourage users to review Cloudflare's privacy practices to understand how they handle and process data.

                <p>
                    GTFKD does not collect personal information through its services. However, certain operational data, such as IP addresses, may be logged temporarily by our gateway provider, Cloudflare, for the purpose of maintaining security and service integrity. This data is stored for a limited time and is not used for any other purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not store or process any personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what is necessary to ensure the proper operation of our services. All data that could be considered identifiable to users is strictly avoided in our data handling practices.
